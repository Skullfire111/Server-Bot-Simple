  Hello!
I am new to python, especially discord.py.
Do to this fact, there are almost certainly many errors that any experienced user would pick out in an instant.
If you have any problems, or notice one of these errors, do your best to notify me. If you know a solution, I'd be happy to give it a try!
Also, please note that I designed this bot specifically for my server, so there are some things you may not need. If you wish to edit the code, but don't want to mess anything up, than just ask what is necessary for the bot to run properly, and I can help you out. For easy customization, I have replaced certain names with generic terms (i.g. what once was a role name is now role),or may have put a word in angle brackets to show that it will varry depending on what you want the command to do (<role> or <role name> are two examples).
  
  If you have any questions, or are seeking help, join my server using https://discord.gg/4wxTbEd, or add me as a friend and DM me at Tyson_Chicken_Nuggets#4978.
